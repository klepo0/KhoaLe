We show propagation of chaos and mean field convergence to the law of the associated McKean--Vlasov equation, as the number of particles $N\to\infty$, with quantitative sharp rates of order $N^{-1/2}$. Our results hold for a wide class of possibly time-dependent interactions, which are only assumed to satisfy a Besov-type regularity, related to the Hurst parameter $H\in &lpar;0,+\infty&rpar;\setminus \mathbb{N}$ of the driving noises. In particular, as $H$ decreases to $0$, interaction kernels of arbitrary singularity can be considered, a phenomenon frequently observed in regularization by noise results. Our proofs rely on a combinations of Sznitman&#39;s direct comparison argument with stochastic sewing techniques.</p></details><details><summary>Konstantinos Dareiotis, Máté Gerencsér, Khoa Lê (2023) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16339v1>A central limit theorem for the Euler method for SDEs with irregular drifts</a></summary>  <p>  The goal of this article is to establish a central limit theorem for the Euler-Maruyama scheme approximating multidimensional SDEs with elliptic Brownian diffusion, under very mild regularity requirements on the drift coefficients. When the drift is H\&quot;older continuous, we show that the limiting law of the rescaled fluctuations around the true solution is characterised as the unique solution of a hybrid Young-It\^o differential equation. When the drift has positive Sobolev regularity, this limit is characterised by the solution of a transformed SDE. Our result is an extension of the results of Jacod-Kurtz-Protter &lpar;1991, 1998&rpar; in which SDEs with differentiable coefficients were considered. To compensate for the lack of regularity of the drifts, we utilize the regularisation effect from the non-degenerate noise.</p></details><details><summary>Lukas Anzeletti, Khoa Lê, Chengcheng Ling (2023) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06802v1>Path-by-path uniqueness for stochastic differential equations under Krylov-R\&quot;ockner condition</a></summary>  <p>  We show that any stochastic differential equation &lpar;SDE&rpar; driven by Brownian motion with drift satisfying the Krylov-R\&quot;ockner condition has exactly one solution in an ordinary sense for almost every trajectory of the Brownian motion. Additionally, we show that such SDE is strongly complete, i.e. for almost every trajectory of the Brownian motion, the family of solutions with different initial data forms a continuous semiflow for all nonnegative times.</p></details><details><summary>Oleg Butkovsky, Khoa Lê, Leonid Mytnik (2023) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11937v1>Stochastic equations with singular drift driven by fractional Brownian motion</a></summary>  <p>  We consider stochastic differential equation $ d X_t=b&lpar;X_t&rpar; dt +d W_t^H, $ where the drift $b$ is either a measure or an integrable function, and $W^H$ is a $d$-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in&lpar;0,1&rpar;$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$. For the case where $b\in L_p&lpar;\mathbb{R}^d&rpar;$, $p\in[1,\infty]$ we show weak existence of solutions to this equation under the condition $ \frac{d}p&lt;\frac1H-1, $ which is an extension of the Krylov-R\&quot;ockner condition &lpar;2005&rpar; to the fractional case. We construct a counter-example showing optimality of this condition. If $b$ is a Radon measure, particularly the delta measure, we prove weak existence of solutions to this equation under the optimal condition $H&lt;\frac1{d+1}$. We also show strong well-posedness of solutions to this equation under certain conditions. To establish these results, we utilize the stochastic sewing technique and develop a new version of the stochastic sewing lemma.</p></details><details><summary>Khoa Lê (2022) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15550v3>Maximal inequalities and weighted BMO processes</a></summary>  <p>  For a general adapted integrable right-continuous with left limits &lpar;RCLL&rpar; process $abstractlpar;X_t&rpar;_{t\in[0,\tau]}$ taking values in a metric space $abstractlpar;\mathcal E,d&rpar;$, we show &lpar;among other things&rpar; that for every $m\in&lpar;1,\infty&rpar;$

  with a universal constant $c$. This is a probabilistic version of Fefferman--Stein estimate for the sharp maximal functions. While the former inequality is derived easily from Doob&#39;s martingale inequality, the later inequality is a consequence of John--Nirenberg inequalities for weighted BMO processes, which are obtained in this note. We explain how John--Nirenberg inequalities can be utilized to obtain inequalities for martingales, both old and new alike in a unified way.</p></details><!-- PREPRINT-LIST:END -->
