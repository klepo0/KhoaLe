Additionally, we show that such SDE is strongly complete, i.e. for almost every trajectory of the Brownian motion, the family of solutions with different initial data forms a continuous semiflow for all nonnegative times.</p></details><details><summary>Oleg Butkovsky, Khoa Lê, Leonid Mytnik (2023) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11937v1>Stochastic equations with singular drift driven by fractional Brownian motion</a></summary>  <p>  We consider stochastic differential equation $ d X_t=b&lpar;X_t&rpar; dt +d W_t^H, $ where the drift $b$ is either a measure or an integrable function, and $W^H$ is a $d$-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in&lpar;0,1&rpar;$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$. For the case where $b\in L_p&lpar;\mathbb{R}^d&rpar;$, $p\in[1,\infty]$ we show weak existence of solutions to this equation under the condition $ \frac{d}p&lt;\frac1H-1, $ which is an extension of the Krylov-R\&quot;ockner condition &lpar;2005&rpar; to the fractional case. We construct a counter-example showing optimality of this condition. If $b$ is a Radon measure, particularly the delta measure, we prove weak existence of solutions to this equation under the optimal condition $H&lt;\frac1{d+1}$. We also show strong well-posedness of solutions to this equation under certain conditions. To establish these results, we utilize the stochastic sewing technique and develop a new version of the stochastic sewing lemma.</p></details><details><summary>Khoa Lê (2022) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15550v3>Maximal inequalities and weighted BMO processes</a></summary>  <p>  For a general adapted integrable right-continuous with left limits &lpar;RCLL&rpar; process $abstractlpar;X_t&rpar;_{t\in[0,\tau]}$ taking values in a metric space $abstractlpar;\mathcal E,d&rpar;$, we show &lpar;among other things&rpar; that for every $m\in&lpar;1,\infty&rpar;$

  with a universal constant $c$. This is a probabilistic version of Fefferman--Stein estimate for the sharp maximal functions. While the former inequality is derived easily from Doob&#39;s martingale inequality, the later inequality is a consequence of John--Nirenberg inequalities for weighted BMO processes, which are obtained in this note. We explain how John--Nirenberg inequalities can be utilized to obtain inequalities for martingales, both old and new alike in a unified way.</p></details><details><summary>Khoa Lê (2022) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15736v2>Quantitative John--Nirenberg inequality for stochastic processes of bounded mean oscillation</a></summary>  <p>  Stroock and Varadhan in 1997 and Geiss in 2005 independently introduced stochastic processes with bounded mean oscillation &lpar;BMO&rpar; and established their exponential integrability with some unspecified exponential constant. This result is an analogue of the John--Nirenberg inequality for functions of bounded mean oscillation. In this work, we quantify the size of the exponential constant by the modulus of mean oscillation. Some new applications of BMO processes in rough stochastic differential equations, numerical approximations and regularization by noise are discussed.</p></details><details><summary>Martin Hairer, Khoa Lê, Tommaso Rosati (2022) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08426v1>The Allen-Cahn equation with generic initial datum</a></summary>  <p>  We consider the Allen-Cahn equation $\partial_t u- \Delta u=u-u^3$ with a rapidly mixing Gaussian field as initial condition. We show that provided that the amplitude of the initial condition is not too large, the equation generates fronts described by nodal sets of the Bargmann-Fock Gaussian field, which then evolve according to mean curvature flow.</p></details><!-- PREPRINT-LIST:END -->
