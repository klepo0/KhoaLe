<!-- PREPRINT-LIST:START --><details><summary>Khoa Lê, Chengcheng Ling - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01343v4>Taming singular stochastic differential equations: A numerical method</a></summary><p>We consider a generic and explicit tamed Euler--Maruyama scheme for multidimensional time-inhomogeneous stochastic differential equations with multiplicative Brownian noise. The diffusion coefficient is uniformly elliptic, H\&quot;older continuous and weakly differentiable in the spatial variables while the drift satisfies the Ladyzhenskaya--Prodi--Serrin condition, as considered by Krylov and R\&quot;ockner &lpar;2005&rpar;. In the discrete scheme, the drift is tamed by replacing it by an approximation. A strong rate of convergence of the scheme is provided in terms of the approximation error of the drift in a suitable and possibly very weak topology. A few examples of approximating drifts are discussed in detail. The parameters of the approximating drifts can vary and be fine-tuned to achieve the standard $1/2$-strong convergence rate with a logarithmic factor.</p></details><details><summary>Peter K. Friz, Antoine Hocquet, Khoa Lê - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10340v1>Rough stochastic differential equations</a></summary><p>A hybrid theory of rough stochastic analysis is built. It seamlessly combines the advantages of both It\^o&#39;s stochastic - and Lyons&#39; rough differential equations. Well-posedness of rough stochastic differential equation is obtained, under natural assumptions and with precise estimates; many examples and applications are mentioned. A major role is played by a new stochastic variant of Gubinelli&#39;s controlled rough paths spaces, with norms that reflect some generalized stochastic sewing lemma, and which may prove useful whenever rough paths and It\^o integration meet.</p></details><details><summary>Khoa Lê - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09364v1>Stochastic sewing in Banach space</a></summary><p>A stochastic sewing lemma which is applicable for processes taking values in Banach spaces is introduced. Applications to additive functionals of fractional Brownian motion of distributional type are discussed.</p></details><details><summary>Konstantinos Dareiotis, Máté Gerencsér, Khoa Lê - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12185v1>Quantifying a convergence theorem of Gy\&quot;ongy and Krylov</a></summary><p>We derive optimal strong convergence rates for the Euler-Maruyama scheme approximating multidimensional SDEs with multiplicative noise without imposing any regularity condition on the drift coefficient. In case the noise is additive, we show that Sobolev regularity can be leveraged to obtain improved rate: drifts with regularity of order $\alpha \in &lpar;0,1&rpar;$ lead to rate $abstractlpar;1+\alpha&rpar;/2$.</p></details><details><summary>Siva Athreya, Oleg Butkovsky, Khoa Lê, Leonid Mytnik - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13498v2>Well-posedness of stochastic heat equation with distributional drift and skew stochastic heat equation</a></summary><p>We study stochastic reaction--diffusion equation $ \partial_tu_t&lpar;x&rpar;=\frac12 \partial^2_{xx}u_t&lpar;x&rpar;+b&lpar;u_t&lpar;x&rpar;&rpar;+\dot{W}_{t}&lpar;x&rpar;, \quad t&gt;0,\, x\in D $ where $b$ is a generalized function in the Besov space $\mathcal{B}^\beta_{q,\infty}&lpar;{\mathbb R}&rpar;$, $D\subset{\mathbb R}$ and $\dot W$ is a space-time white noise on ${\mathbb R}_+\times D$. We introduce a notion of a solution to this equation and obtain existence and uniqueness of a strong solution whenever $\beta-1/q\ge-1$, $\beta&gt;-1$ and $q\in[1,\infty]$. This class includes equations with $b$ being measures, in particular, $b=\delta_0$ which corresponds to the skewed stochastic heat equation. For $\beta-1/q &gt; -3/2$, we obtain existence of a weak solution. Our results extend the work of Bass and Chen &lpar;2001&rpar; to the framework of stochastic partial differential equations and generalizes the results of Gy\&quot;ongy and Pardoux &lpar;1993&rpar; to distributional drifts. To establish these results, we exploit the regularization effect of the white noise through a new strategy based on the stochastic sewing lemma introduced in L\^e~&lpar;2020&rpar;.</p></details><!-- PREPRINT-LIST:END -->
