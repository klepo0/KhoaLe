We assume that the diffusion coefficient is a regular function which is bounded away from zero. By using a combination of stochastic sewing techniques and Malliavin calculus, we show that the equation admits a unique solution.</p></details><details><summary>Zimo Hao, Khoa Lê, Chengcheng Ling (2024) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05706v1>Quantitative approximation of stochastic kinetic equations: from discrete to continuum</a></summary>  <p>  We study the convergence of a generic tamed Euler-Maruyama &lpar;EM&rpar; scheme for the kinetic type stochastic differential equations &lpar;SDEs&rpar; &lpar;also known as second order SDEs&rpar; with singular coefficients in both weak and strong probabilistic senses. We show that when the drift exhibits a relatively low regularity compared to the state of the art, the singular system is well-defined both in the weak and strong probabilistic senses. Meanwhile, the corresponding tamed EM scheme is shown to converge at the rate of 1/2 in both the weak and the strong senses.</p></details><details><summary>Lucio Galeati, Khoa Lê, Avi Mayorcas (2024) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05454v1>Quantitative Propagation of Chaos for Singular Interacting Particle Systems Driven by Fractional Brownian Motion</a></summary>  <p>  We consider interacting systems particle driven by i.i.d. fractional Brownian motions, subject to irregular, possibly distributional, pairwise interactions. We show propagation of chaos and mean field convergence to the law of the associated McKean--Vlasov equation, as the number of particles $N\to\infty$, with quantitative sharp rates of order $N^{-1/2}$. Our results hold for a wide class of possibly time-dependent interactions, which are only assumed to satisfy a Besov-type regularity, related to the Hurst parameter $H\in &lpar;0,+\infty&rpar;\setminus \mathbb{N}$ of the driving noises. In particular, as $H$ decreases to $0$, interaction kernels of arbitrary singularity can be considered, a phenomenon frequently observed in regularization by noise results. Our proofs rely on a combinations of Sznitman&#39;s direct comparison argument with stochastic sewing techniques.</p></details><details><summary>Konstantinos Dareiotis, Máté Gerencsér, Khoa Lê (2023) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16339v1>A central limit theorem for the Euler method for SDEs with irregular drifts</a></summary>  <p>  The goal of this article is to establish a central limit theorem for the Euler-Maruyama scheme approximating multidimensional SDEs with elliptic Brownian diffusion, under very mild regularity requirements on the drift coefficients. When the drift is H\&quot;older continuous, we show that the limiting law of the rescaled fluctuations around the true solution is characterised as the unique solution of a hybrid Young-It\^o differential equation. When the drift has positive Sobolev regularity, this limit is characterised by the solution of a transformed SDE. Our result is an extension of the results of Jacod-Kurtz-Protter &lpar;1991, 1998&rpar; in which SDEs with differentiable coefficients were considered. To compensate for the lack of regularity of the drifts, we utilize the regularisation effect from the non-degenerate noise.</p></details><details><summary>Lukas Anzeletti, Khoa Lê, Chengcheng Ling (2023) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06802v1>Path-by-path uniqueness for stochastic differential equations under Krylov-R\&quot;ockner condition</a></summary>  <p>  We show that any stochastic differential equation &lpar;SDE&rpar; driven by Brownian motion with drift satisfying the Krylov-R\&quot;ockner condition has exactly one solution in an ordinary sense for almost every trajectory of the Brownian motion. Additionally, we show that such SDE is strongly complete, i.e. for almost every trajectory of the Brownian motion, the family of solutions with different initial data forms a continuous semiflow for all nonnegative times.</p></details><!-- PREPRINT-LIST:END -->
