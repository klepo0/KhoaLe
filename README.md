The diffusion coefficient is uniformly elliptic, H\&quot;older continuous and weakly differentiable in the spatial variables while the drift satisfies the Ladyzhenskaya--Prodi--Serrin condition, as considered by Krylov and R\&quot;ockner &lpar;2005&rpar;. In the discrete scheme, the drift is tamed by replacing it by an approximation. A strong rate of convergence of the scheme is provided in terms of the approximation error of the drift in a suitable and possibly very weak topology. A few examples of approximating drifts are discussed in detail. The parameters of the approximating drifts can vary and be fine-tuned to achieve the standard $1/2$-strong convergence rate with a logarithmic factor.</p></details><details><summary>Peter K. Friz, Antoine Hocquet, Khoa Lê (2021) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10340v2>Rough stochastic differential equations</a></summary>  <p>  We build a hybrid theory of rough stochastic analysis which seamlessly combines the advantages of both It\^o&#39;s stochastic and Lyons&#39; rough differential equations. This gives a direct and intrinsic understanding of multidimensional diffusion with Brownian noise $abstractlpar;B,\tilde B&rpar;$ $

  $ in the annealed form, when conditioned on its environmental noise $\tilde B$. This situation arises naturally e.g. in filtering theory, for Feynman--Kac representations of solutions to stochastic partial differential equations, in Lions--Souganidis&#39; theory of pathwise stochastic control, and for McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equations with common noise. In fact, we establish well-posedness of rough stochastic differential equations, with $\tilde B$ replaced by a genuine rough path. As consequence, the `annealed&#39; process $Y$ is a locally Lipschitz function of its environmental noise in rough path metrics. There is also interest in taking $\tilde B=\tilde B^H$, a fractional Brownian motion which fits our theory for $H&gt;1/3$. Our assumptions for $b,\sigma$ agree with those from It\^o theory, those for $f$ with rough paths theory, including an extension of Davie&#39;s critical regularity result for deterministic rough differential equations. A major role in our analysis is played by a new scale of stochastic controlled rough paths spaces, related to a $abstractlpar;L^m,L^n&rpar;$-variant of stochastic sewing.</p></details><details><summary>Khoa Lê (2021) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09364v2>Stochastic sewing in Banach space</a></summary>  <p>  A stochastic sewing lemma which is applicable for processes taking values in Banach spaces is introduced. Applications to additive functionals of fractional Brownian motion of distributional type are discussed.</p></details><details><summary>Konstantinos Dareiotis, Máté Gerencsér, Khoa Lê (2021) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12185v1>Quantifying a convergence theorem of Gy\&quot;ongy and Krylov</a></summary>  <p>  We derive optimal strong convergence rates for the Euler-Maruyama scheme approximating multidimensional SDEs with multiplicative noise without imposing any regularity condition on the drift coefficient. In case the noise is additive, we show that Sobolev regularity can be leveraged to obtain improved rate: drifts with regularity of order $\alpha \in &lpar;0,1&rpar;$ lead to rate $abstractlpar;1+\alpha&rpar;/2$.</p></details><details><summary>Siva Athreya, Oleg Butkovsky, Khoa Lê, Leonid Mytnik (2020) - <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13498v2>Well-posedness of stochastic heat equation with distributional drift and skew stochastic heat equation</a></summary>  <p>  We study stochastic reaction--diffusion equation $ \partial_tu_t&lpar;x&rpar;=\frac12 \partial^2_{xx}u_t&lpar;x&rpar;+b&lpar;u_t&lpar;x&rpar;&rpar;+\dot{W}_{t}&lpar;x&rpar;, \quad t&gt;0,\, x\in D $ where $b$ is a generalized function in the Besov space $\mathcal{B}^\beta_{q,\infty}&lpar;{\mathbb R}&rpar;$, $D\subset{\mathbb R}$ and $\dot W$ is a space-time white noise on ${\mathbb R}_+\times D$. We introduce a notion of a solution to this equation and obtain existence and uniqueness of a strong solution whenever $\beta-1/q\ge-1$, $\beta&gt;-1$ and $q\in[1,\infty]$. This class includes equations with $b$ being measures, in particular, $b=\delta_0$ which corresponds to the skewed stochastic heat equation. For $\beta-1/q &gt; -3/2$, we obtain existence of a weak solution. Our results extend the work of Bass and Chen &lpar;2001&rpar; to the framework of stochastic partial differential equations and generalizes the results of Gy\&quot;ongy and Pardoux &lpar;1993&rpar; to distributional drifts. To establish these results, we exploit the regularization effect of the white noise through a new strategy based on the stochastic sewing lemma introduced in L\^e~&lpar;2020&rpar;.</p></details><!-- PREPRINT-LIST:END -->
